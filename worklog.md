I want to get back on track, so I spent 0,5 hours with practice today. The sum of my overall work is 0+0,5 hours now.

My main goal for today was: to learn how to create packages and a basic java application.

These are the tasks I did today to achieve my goal:

Get familiar with IntellJ.
Learn how to create package and how does it work.
Learn how to create class inside my package.

These are the links I studied today to achieve my goal:
